//  Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes of buildings
//  for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write
//  a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building, then displays
//  the minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.
